## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient balance" error
→ Make sure you have TKA tokens in your wallet

### "Please switch network" error  
→ Switch MetaMask to Celo Sepolia (Chain ID: 11142220)

### "Wallet not connected" error
→ Click "Connect Wallet" button first

### No demo banner showing
→ Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SWAP_MODE=true`
→ Restart dev server after changing env

### Transaction fails
→ Check you have CELO for gas fees
→ Make sure token is approved

## ✨ Pro Tips
